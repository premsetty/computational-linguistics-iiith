Present Functionalities:
1. Selection of language
2. Jumbleing of words
3. When u click the button of a word, it dissappears and the corresponding word
	appears below as a sentence
4. Check the correctness, checks the sentence from a pool of correct answers
	and if ur answer is correct, it highlights in green
5. Upon a wrong answer, there appears a button that says get correct sentence,
	which lists all the correct possible answers from the pool.
6. Reform sentence button resets everything back.


More functionality ideas:

1. Under experiment tab: There should be a button to change the given question
	(i.e, to get a different question)

2. Under quizzes tab: There should be an option to select the correct answer
	of the question. And it should notify that whether thats the right answer
	or incorrect.
